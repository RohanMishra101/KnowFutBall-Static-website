            <p>
              A popular team sport across the world, football is played between
              two teams of eleven players each. It is played on a rectangular
              field with a goal at either end using a spherical ball. The
              purpose of the game is to score by placing the ball in the goal of
              the other team, mostly using the feet, however, other body
              parts—aside from the hands and arms—may also be utilized. After
              the game, the side with the most goals wins.

                  The Football Association (FA), established in England in 1863,
                  established the rules of modern football. This event was
                  significant because it established the boundaries between
                  rugby and football and helped to codify the rules that would
                  later form the foundation of the game.

                  between national teams, this match is important because it
                  opened up international competition.

                  World Cup championships (1958, 1962, 1970) that set records.
                  Though his professional accomplishments are unmatched, his
                  influence goes much beyond the numbers. As the person who
                  popularized the sport and inspired millions of people
                  worldwide, Pelé is a global icon. Despite his passing in 2022,
                  his reputation as one of the all-time great football players
                  is still deeply ingrained in the memories of both players and
                  spectators.

                  Born in Rosario, Argentina, on June 24, 1987, Lionel Messi is

                  time. He started his career at FC Barcelona and worked his way
                  up to become a key member of the squad. Messi became an
                  incredible talent throughout his 20 years at Barcelona,
                  renowned for his flawless dribbling, outstanding vision, and
                  remarkable goal-scoring ability. In2022, Messi fulfilled a
                  long-held ambition of his by helping Argentina win their
                  first-ever Copa America championship. Messi was instrumental
                  in Argentina's historic World Cup triumph in 2022, which saw
                  him return the prized trophy to his native country for the

                <p>
                  On the pitch, the legendary Argentine player was unstoppable.
                  His intense zeal drove his amazing dribbling abilities,
                  captivating control, and accurate passing. He made history in
                  football when he led Argentina to the World Cup in 1986 on his
                  own. Despite the controversies that dogged his career, he
                  still has the unrivaled ability to motivate his squad and
                  enthrall the audience with his charismatic leadership.
                  Regretfully, Maradona went away in 2020, but not before
                  leaving a legacy that goes beyond football and still
                  motivating fans and athletes alike.
